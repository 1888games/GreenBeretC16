# GreenBeretC16
Disassembly of the infamously dreadful game for the Commodore 16. I have added better graphics and some tweaks to gameplay to see a playable game can be salvaged.

This is work in progress and contains level 1 only. I have a feeling the other levels are completely self-contained programs so any changes I make to level 1 will have to be repeated on the other three.

Most of the code remains uncommented, I've only figured out the stuff I needed to make the changes below. There will also be blocks of code currently displayed as data and vice versa, disassemblers aren't perfect!

Improvements so far

* Switched to multicolour character mode
* Replaced background and sprite characters with multicolour versions
* Changed background 'colour strips' to shades of red
* Bullets are slower and more visible
* Enemies will not fire from point-blank range
* Enemies and bullets must be closer to kill the player
