# GreenBeretC16
Disassembly of the infamously dreadful game for the Commodore 16. I have added better graphics and some tweaks to gameplay to see a playable game can be salvaged. WIP - Currently level 1 only.

Most of the code remains uncommented, I've only figured out the stuff I needed to make the changes below.
There will also blocks of code currently displayed as data and vice versa, disassemblers aren't perfect!

* Improvements so far

Switched to multicolour character mode
Replaced background and sprite characters with multicolour versions
Changed background 'colour strips' to shades of red
Bullets are slower and more visible
Enemies will not fire from point-blank range
Enemies and bullets must be closer to kill the player
